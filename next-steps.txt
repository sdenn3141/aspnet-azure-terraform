Better Security

1. Use User Managed Identity for SQL connection between Web app.
2. Get rid of hardcoded SQL server credentials and use Entra Admin instead.
3. Upgrade web app to premium plan (P0v3) and integrate with a VNet. Create private endpoint for SQL server and disable SQL public network access. 

Higher Availability

1. Deploy MSSQL to multiple regions with a read replica.
2. Deploy web app to multiple regions and point at respective regional read replica.
3. Use a better sku of database (increases CPU) and also increases backup retention to over 30 days instead of 7.

Pipeline:

1. Add a deployment slot to the web app. Run e2e tests on the web app before swapping. Also include unit + integration tests within the pipeline.
2. Add gates before allowing deploying of terraform
3. Only run terraform when terraform files change and only run build/deploy when .cs files change.
